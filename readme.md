To execute the script, python 3.7.x is required

Create a virtual environment within your directory 
"python -m venv <directory>"

or should you decide to just install all the dependents on your host machine, you do not require a virtual environment

and install the packages required within the requirements.txt file with
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

to run the script
"python horriblesubsbatch.py"

or
"path/to/python/installation horriblesubsbatch.py"
if the installation folder is not added to your PATH
