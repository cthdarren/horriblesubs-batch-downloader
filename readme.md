# HorribleSubs Batch Downloader

This project was started because I was too lazy to click each and every link for anime with no batch downloads. 
### Features
 - Resolution Selection
 - Batch download if available
 - Easy to use GUI
 
 ### Planned Features 
 - Episode range selection
 - Best quality option
 
## Setup
Setup should be as fast as double clicking on the batch file, as well as running the application

### Prerequisites

Only thing required for this application to work is Python 3.7.x


### Installing

Run the setup.bat in order to setup the environment. If that isn't an option, follow the steps below

(Optional) Create a virtual environment within the cloned repo

```
python -m venv .
```

Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Running the application

To start the application, run the start.bat file. If that doesn't work, follow the steps below once again

(If you have created a virtual environment) Run the script to activate the environment

```
.\Scripts\activate
```

Run the script
```
python horriblesubsbatch.py
```
